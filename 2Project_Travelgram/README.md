This is the second web_dev project of the Rocketseat course.

Here it's a webpage inspired by Instagram but focusing just in trip pictures.

In the page there is a nav bar (non-resposive). Followed by a profile section, that contains informations about the user, for instace their photo, name and personal description.

Then, the main of the page contains the twelve user's photos from differente places around the world.

Finally, there is a footer with the brand of the company, Terms of Use, and Privacy policy.

I thank Rocketseat for helping me to develop this project.

Last but not least, thank you for being here.
